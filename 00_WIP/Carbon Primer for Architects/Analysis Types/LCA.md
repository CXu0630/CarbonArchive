## Definition
LCA is a method of environmental accounting. An LCA tracks the inputs from nature (raw materials such as limestone, water, and coal) and outputs to nature (such as waste, carbon dioxide and methane) considering all of the processes that take place during manufacture, use, and disposal. ^def

The raw collected data used for an LCA originates from an [[LCI]]. The data is then processed into an [[LCIA]] where the impacts of the raw data from the LCI is assessed, completing the LCA process.

In architecture, the most commonly dealt with LCAs are [[WBLCA]]s (whole building life cycle assessment) and LCAs for specific materials.

## LCA Phases
### 1. Goal and Scope Definition
[[ISO14040]] series requires a goal and scope be stated for an LCA study:

![[ISO14040#14044 LCA Goal]]

![[ISO14040#14044 LCA Scope]]

For a building, the scope is usually a subset of the life cycle phases of the building:
