## Definition
LCA is a method of environmental accounting. An LCA tracks the inputs from nature (raw materials such as limestone, water, and coal) and outputs to nature (such as waste, carbon dioxide and methane) considering all of the processes that take place during manufacture, use, and disposal. 

The data used for an LCA originates from an [[LCI]].

In architecture, the most commonly delt with LCAs are [[WBLCA]]s (whole building life cycle assessment) and LCAs for specific materials.
