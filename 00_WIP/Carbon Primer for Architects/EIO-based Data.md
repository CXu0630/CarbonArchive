## Definition
EIO is a method of measuring life-cycle data. It is one of two most common processes, the other being [[Process-based Data]]. EIO is short for Economic Input-Output (EIO). EIO databases analyze the carbon emissions across entire economic sectors by considering interdependencies between industries. EIO models use national or regional economic data, typically in the form of input-output tables, combined with carbon emissions data for each sector. Industry average data is often used.

## Qualities
EIO-based data often has a broad scope, but lacks refinement. This method is good for analyzing the overall impact of supply chains, but has difficulty differentiating between variations in production techniques or specific material sources.
