## Definition
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a scientific method for evaluating the environmental impact of a product or activity over its entire life cycle. It's also known as a "cradle-to-grave" analysis. The complete process of LCA includes goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation. The process is naturally iterative as the quality and completeness of information and its plausibility is constantly being tested.
