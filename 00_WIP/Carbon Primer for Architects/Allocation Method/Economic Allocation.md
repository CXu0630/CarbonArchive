## Definition
Physical allocation is an [[Allocation Method]] that assigns LCA impact to an output of a multi-functional production process based on the market price of the outputs. Economic allocation is often used to calculate the impacts of services where [[Physical Allocation]] is not an option. ^def

## Example
 An example is given by [Sustainability Impact Metrics](https://www.ecocostsvalue.com/lca/the-issue-of-allocation/), from Delft University of Technology:
 
> Economic allocation can be explained by an example: the indirect environmental impact of building an air plane, allocated to a single trip. The main parameters are: 
> 
>1. the value of a ticket for the single trip, $W$, of which a part of that value, $X$, is related to the depreciation (or leasing costs) of the plane  
>2. the value of a plane, $Y$  
>3. the eco- costs of a plane, $Z$ (calculated from LCA data).
> 
> The question is now which part of the indirect environmental impact of building a plane, Z, has to be allocated to the trip. Applying economic allocation:
> 
> $EI = \left( \frac{X}{Y} \right) \times Z = \text{“the economic proportion”} \times \text{“Environmental Impact”}$
> 
> Where EI is the indirect environmental impact allocated to the ticket, which can be written as:
> 
> $EI = \left( \frac{Z}{Y} \right) \times X = EVR \times \text{“part of the value of the ticket related to the depreciation of the plane”}$
