## Definition
The "Allocation, cut-off, EN15804" method is defined by Ecoinvent. The model aims to facilitate [[1.8.3 EPD]] practitioners to comply with the standard EN15804 and to contribute to the harmonization in the calculation of indicators of the standard. 

This method uses [[Characterization Factor]]s based on the [[EF]] method. It incorporates indicators from [[EN15804]] and [[ISO21930]] required in EPDs.
