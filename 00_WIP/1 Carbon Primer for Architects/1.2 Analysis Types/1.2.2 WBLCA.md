## Definition
Whole building life cycle assessments (WBLCA) measure all of the flows between a building and nature over its lifetime and then estimates the resulting impacts on air, land and water. The cradle-to-grave lifetime of a building includes manufacturing and transporting of construction materials, the process of construction, a long phase of building occupancy and maintenance, demolition, and removal of waste materials. Resources are consumed and emissions created during every life phase. ^def

A general graph representing life cycle stages of a building.

Carbon calculations in WBLCAs can be broken down into [[1.2.5 Embodied Carbon]] and [[1.2.6 Operational Carbon]].
