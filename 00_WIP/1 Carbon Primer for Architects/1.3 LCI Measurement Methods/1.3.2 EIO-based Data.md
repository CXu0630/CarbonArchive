## Definition
EIO is a method of measuring life-cycle data. It is one of two most common processes, the other being [[1.3.1 Process-based Data]]. EIO is short for Economic Input-Output (EIO). EIO databases analyze the carbon emissions across entire economic sectors by considering interdependencies between industries. EIO models use national or regional economic data, typically in the form of input-output tables, combined with carbon emissions data for each sector. Industry average data is often used.

EIO analysis divides the economy into different sectors and tracks sales between sectors. An EIO estimates the production required in all sectors of the economy to support increases in output of any given sector. An EIO-LCI includes environmental emissions for the activity in each sector, making it possible to compute all upstream production impacts of an increase in production of one sector.
## Qualities
#### Advantages
- fast screening level LCA
- broad scope
#### Disadvantages
- unable to conduct comparisons within a sector
- data availability may be more outdated as it relies on reporting by entire sectors
- less capacity for imported products
- limited by granularity of economic sector divisions

## Example
The following is an example of an EIO-based LCI from [[Life Cycle Assessment, Kathrina Simonen]] pp.75.
