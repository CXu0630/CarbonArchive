## Definition
PlasticsEurope is a free LCA database specialized in plastic materials. Data on major polymers produced in Europe is provided. 
## Measurement
PlasticsEurope's Eco-Profiles are calculated using average values from the industry, then weighted depending on manufacturer's production.
## Scope
Cradle-to-gate.
Raw material extraction, emissions to air and water, and waste generated are included, as well as transport delivered from production, vehicle maintenance, and the replacement of batteries and tires.
