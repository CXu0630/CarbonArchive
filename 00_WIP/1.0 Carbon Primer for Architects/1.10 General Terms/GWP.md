Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a measure of the amount of heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere over a period of time. GWP is often measured relative to the global warming properties of carbon dioxide. GWPs for gases other than CO2 are represented in their carbon dioxide equivalents.

GWP is often measured over a period of time, since half-life varies greatly across different gases. The value for GWP over 20 years, for instance, is represented as GWP-20 or GWP20a. 

For instance, [[Methane has a GWP-20 of 81.2]], but [[Methane has a GWP-100 of 27.9]]. This is because it has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide.
