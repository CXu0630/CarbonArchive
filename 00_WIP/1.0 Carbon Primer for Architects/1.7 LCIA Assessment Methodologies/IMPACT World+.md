## Definition
IMPACT World+ is developed in a collaboration between CIRAIG, University of Michigan, Quantis International, Technical University of Denmark, and EPFL. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art developments as well as damages on water and carbon areas of concern within a consistent LCIA framework. Most of the regional impact categories have been spatially differentiated and all long-term impact categories have been subdivided into shorter-term damage (the first 100 years after the emission) and long-term damage categories.
