## Definition
Life cycle inventory assessment (LCIA) databases analyze the results of [[1.1.1 LCI]]s for environmental impact. 

## Example
Manufacturing a product may consume a known volume of natural gas (this data is part of the inventory or the [[1.1.1 LCI]]); in the LCIA phase, the global warming impact from combustion of that fuel is calculated.
