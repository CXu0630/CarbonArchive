## Definition 
Environmental product declarations (EPDs) present LCA results for products.

As outlined by ISO14025, EPDs should be:
- based on LCA data developed in accordance with ISO
- based on established rules for conducting LCAs
- verified by a third party

Other standards such as [[ISO 21930]] and [[CEN 15804]] are used to provide core rules for EPDs of building products.
