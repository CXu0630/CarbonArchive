## Definition
Process-based measurement is a method of measuring life-cycle data. It is one of two most common processes, the other being [[EIO-based Data]]. Process-based measurements are based on direct measurement or detailed modeling of the specific steps involved in producing a material or product. This method includes emissions data from each stage of the production process, such as raw material extraction, processing, and manufacturing.

## Qualities
**High Specificity and Granularity**
Process-based measurements are specific to each product measured, so produces specific and exact results. This method reflects differences in production method, material sources, and technology.

**Time and Labor Intensive**
This method requires detailed measurements for every step.

**Can Overlook Indirect Measurements**
Indirect emissions from broader supply chain, especially for upstream or secondary processes may be overlooked as they are not a step in the production process that is directly accounted for. 

## Example
The following is an example of an item in a process-based LCI from [[Life Cycle Assessment, Kathrina Simonen]].
