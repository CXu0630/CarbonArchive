## Definition
BEDEC contains economic and environmental information for more than half a million variations of construction elements. Information on embodied energy, CO2 emissions, and waste disposal are provided. 
## Scope
Cradle to gate
## Note
No documentation is available. Dataset is unverifiable. It is only known that the data is sourced from several organizations and enterprises and that collaborations with the [[ICAEN]], Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and the Technological Centre of Construction have also helped build this dataset. Data from [[Ecoinvent]] is also integrated. 

Despite this issue, BEDEC is the most widely used database in Spain for environmental studies in building construction.
