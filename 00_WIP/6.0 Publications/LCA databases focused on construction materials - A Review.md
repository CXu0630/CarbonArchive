## Notes
This text compares various databases from Europe and North America based on six chosen features for comparison: scope, completeness, transparency, comprehensiveness, update, license.

The databases selected are:
#### European
[[Ecoinvent]]
[[ELCD]]
[[GaBi]]
[[PlasticsEurope]]

#### American
[[Athena]]
[[U.S.LCI]]

#### National
[[Base Carbone]]
[[BEDEC]]
[[CPM]]
[[ProBas]]

### Conclusions
The study concludes that [[GaBi]] and [[Ecoinvent]] are the two most complete an prominent databases, while [[ELCD]] is the best free database, combining data from various industries.

The study concludes that the [[1.2.4 CED]] for the same material from the various databases noticeably fluctuated depending on the database used. The study finds it unlikely, however, that the energy consumption in different countries differ by that much.
