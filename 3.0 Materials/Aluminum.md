## Embodied Carbon
Aluminum is known to be one of the most energy-intensive construction materials (200MJ/kg). A high recycling rate for aluminum is also possible. 100% recycled aluminum can reach 19MJ/kg embodied energy.

[[LCA databases focused on construction materials - A Review]] gives an analysis of the embodied carbon contents of aluminum according to various databases:
