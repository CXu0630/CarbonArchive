## Definition
Self-declared labels are single-attribute environmental claims such as recycled content and energy consumption. Companies can identify the targets and label their products accordingly.

As outlined by ISO14021, self-declared labels should be:
- single attribute
- internally verified
- meet internally identified performance targets

==It would appear that products who claim to be net-zero carbon may fall under this category?
