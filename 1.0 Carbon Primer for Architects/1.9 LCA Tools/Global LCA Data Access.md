## Definition
The Global LCA Data Access network (GLAD) is the largest non-commercial directory of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) datasets. The platform is managed by the [[Life Cycle Initiative]]. Database hosts volunteer their databases to participate in GLAD. The data is required to meet interoperability requirements between file types and standards. GLAD theoretically allows the conversion between common file types.

GLAD can be used to conduct blanket searches through a large number of databases.
