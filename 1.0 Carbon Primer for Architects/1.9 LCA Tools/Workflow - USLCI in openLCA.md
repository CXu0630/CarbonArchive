## Definition
The [[U.S.LCI]] database is defined with a specific material flow that doesn't integrate with the default flows of many [[1.7 LCIA Methodologies]]. It also requires some additional libraries and tools that are unavailable directly.

#### Libraries
After importing the database into openLCA, if it requires additional libraries, download them here:

#### Methodologies
Common methodologies can be converted into formats that are compatible with USLCI with the LCIAformatter python script tool:

1. Install python
2. Install the tool
3. Use an example or modify one
