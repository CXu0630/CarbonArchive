## Definition
CML is by the Institute of Environmental Sciences of the University of Leiden in 2001. It is a midpoint method assessing several environmental impact categories. 

The CML method was one of the first systematic LCIA methods. It was created to establish a rigorous, objective, and universally applicable midpoint framework for LCAs, ensuring that environmental assessments are grounded in scientific consensus and practical utility.
