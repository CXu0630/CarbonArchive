## Definition
LCIA methods are used to transform [[1.1.1 LCI]]s to [[1.1.2 LCIA]]s. LCIA methods define [[Characterization Factor]]s to interpret raw measurements with. They also define environmental impacts to measure for and the factors that need to be aggregated for each impact.

The environmental impacts measured by LCIA methods can be categorized as following, where impacts are further extrapolated into "Areas of Protection"s.

LCIA Methodologies often contain the following information:

- **Impact Categories** – The environmental themes being assessed, such as:
    - **Climate Change** (e.g., GWP from IPCC)
    - **Eutrophication** (nutrient pollution in water)
    - **Acidification** (sulfur and nitrogen emissions)
    - **Ozone Depletion** (CFCs and halons)
    - **Human Toxicity** (heavy metals, carcinogens)
    - **Ecotoxicity** (harm to ecosystems)
    - **Resource Depletion** (fossil fuels, minerals)
    - **Land Use & Biodiversity Loss**

- **Characterization Factors** – Numerical values that convert raw LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) data into impact indicators.
    - Example: IPCC assigns **CO₂-equivalents (CO₂e)** to greenhouse gases based on their warming potential.

- **Midpoint vs. Endpoint Approach**
    - **Midpoint**: Focuses on specific environmental problems (e.g., acidification potential in kg SO₂-equivalents).
    - **Endpoint**: Aggregates impacts into broader categories like human health, ecosystem damage, and resource depletion.

- **Fate and Exposure Models** – Mathematical models predicting how pollutants move through air, water, and soil, affecting different regions and time scales.

- **Regionalization** – Some methodologies (like IMPACT World+) adjust impact factors based on geographic differences (e.g., water scarcity varies by region).
