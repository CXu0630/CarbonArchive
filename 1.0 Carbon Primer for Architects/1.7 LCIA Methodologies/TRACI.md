## Definition
The **TRACI LCIA Method** (Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts) is a **midpoint-oriented Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)** methodology developed by the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** in 2012. Designed specifically for the U.S. context, TRACI evaluates environmental impacts by focusing on regionally relevant factors, making it a preferred choice for assessments aligned with U.S. regulations and ecological conditions.

## Impact Categories
### Midpoint
1. **Global Warming Potential (GWP)**:
    - CO₂-equivalents (100-year horizon, aligned with IPCC).
2. **Acidification**:
    - SO₂-equivalents, reflecting U.S. ecosystem sensitivity.
3. **Eutrophication**:
    - N-equivalents (nitrogen) for freshwater and marine impacts.
4. **Ozone Depletion**:
    - CFC-11 equivalents.
5. **Photochemical Smog Formation**:
    - NOₓ-equivalents (tropospheric ozone creation).
6. **Human Health Impacts**:
    - **Cancer** and **Non-Cancer** effects (risk-based, using U.S. population data).
7. **Ecotoxicity**:
    - Freshwater toxic impacts (CTUe – Comparative Toxic Units).
8. **Fossil Fuel Depletion**:
    - MJ surplus energy (resource scarcity).
9. **Water Use**:
    - Added in TRACI 2.1, assessing water scarcity in U.S. watersheds.
