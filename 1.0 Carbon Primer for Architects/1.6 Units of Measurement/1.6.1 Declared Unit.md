## Definition
Declared units are necessary for carbon databases and EPDs. They are quantified reference units used to express the environmental impact of a product **without** a defined function or use scenario. In an EPD for instance, a material may have $X \space kgCO_2e$ of embodied carbon per declared unit of $1 \space kg$ of material.

Declared units are often used in [[1.2.1 LCA]]s and similar analysis when the [[1.6.2 Functional Unit]] is not available or when the data for the material can be used in many different applications.
