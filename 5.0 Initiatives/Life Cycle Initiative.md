## Definition
(from the about page of Life Cycle Initiative)

The Life Cycle Initiative, hosted by [[UNEP - United Nations Environment Programme]], promotes Life Cycle knowledge, which reveals the unintended trade-offs between the social, environmental, and economic impacts of circular approaches. This makes Life Cycle thinking essential for decision-making to foster progress towards sustainable production and consumption patterns. To achieve this, the initiative works to build international consensus and access to science-based life cycle knowledge and to improve the application of life cycle knowledge by private and public decision makers with (policy) advice and capacity building. The Initiative is focusing its work on high-impact sectors.Â The Initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership (including governments, businesses, scientific and civil society organizations) and launched in 2002 by UNEP and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC).
