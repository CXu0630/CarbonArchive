# Carbon Archive

By the mid-20th century, Earth had already surpassed Pleistocene levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, reaching concentrations not seen in millions of years. Since then, carbon emissions have continued to rise annually. It is no surprise, then, that 2024 stands as Earth’s warmest year on record. The escalating frequency and severity of natural disasters—from hurricanes to wildfires—underscore the urgent need for action. Humanity faces an increasingly critical challenge: atmospheric carbon levels must be reduced. Architects, whose industry contributes nearly 40% of global carbon emissions, are uniquely positioned to influence construction and manufacturing practices in combating the climate crisis.

This research aims to empower architects to reduce the embodied carbon of their designs. Building on the Woodchuck Carbon Tool—a previous project that developed a Rhino3D plugin connecting users to various carbon databases—the current initiative seeks to expand and refine the tool. The research will critically analyze existing carbon databases for building materials, uncovering discrepancies, ambiguities, and potential biases within these datasets. By integrating an enhanced collection of carbon databases into the Woodchuck Carbon Tool (also referred to as Woodchuck), this project will facilitate a series of cross-examinations to compare the carbon contents of common building assemblies and evaluate the reliability of the databases themselves.

This repository houses the in-progress research on carbon databases and all things carbon that are encountered along this research journey. It is not indicative of the final website which will be published by the end of the research.
